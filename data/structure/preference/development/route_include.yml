# This file is supposed to configure a group of some common preferences to configure routes in route.yml.
# You may specify common preferences set here by 'include' directive in route.yml.
#
# e.g.
# common:
#     method: GET
#     params: id=int
#     content: json
#     template: false
#     layoute: false
#
# In order to set the above preferences you must write 'include' directive like:
#
# FooHandler:
#     path: /foo
#     method: foo
#     include: common 
#
# BarHandler:
#     path: /bar
#     method: bar
#     include: common
